# POO-JavaReflectionExample
A simple example to demonstrate the concepts of reflection in Java.

In general, computational reflection, or simply reflection, allows programs to inspect and or modify their own structure (e.g., attributes and methods) and behavior (in terms of how the program is executed). The concept was first introduced, for procedural programming languages, by Brian Cantwell Smith in his PhD thesis at MIT in 1982 (https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/15961) and then adapted for object-oriented programming by Patie Maes in 1987 (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/38765.38821).

The Java language implements a limited, yet powerful, subset of the more general reflection capabilities. While reflection in Java does not allow a program to modify itself, it allows programs to discover a lot of internal information about internal structure, which is often useful in cases where, e.g., a program needs to handle classes that were unknown when the program was written.

The examples found here a based on the tutorial found in https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javareflection.html.
